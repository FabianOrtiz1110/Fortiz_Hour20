1. Hard, because the balls have a small hitbox
Hard, because the game doesn't have an end goal.
Easy, because of how slow everything is.

2. I would 1) increase speed to make it harder, 2) increase powerup size to make it easier to grab, and finally make the space mechanic be able to
grab powerups.

3. A finish line, a veriety of textures  and levels, and an increase of powerups and abilities

4. the fact the game is simplistic, that it can go on forever allowing you to achieve higher scores, and collecting powerups and dodging obstacles.

5.the powerups can phase a bit when picking up, the game has no finish line, and the player speed is a bit slow.
